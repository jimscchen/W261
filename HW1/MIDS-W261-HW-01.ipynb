In other words, you need an output file with only 2 lines, one giving you the number of words staring with a lowercase ('a' to 'z'), and the other line indicating the number of words starting with an uppercase letter ('A' to 'Z'). In the pWordCount.sh, please insert a sort command between the mappers (after the for loop) and the reducer calls to collate the output key-value pair records by key from the mappers. E.g., sort -k1,1. Use \"man sort\" to learn more about Unix sorts."
